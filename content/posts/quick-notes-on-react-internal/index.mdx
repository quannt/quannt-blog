1. Convert JSX to an object (using Babel and a method called React.creatElement).

    The result is an object that looks like this

    ```jsx
    const element = {
      type: "h1",
      props: {
        title: "foo",
        children: "Hello",
      },
    }
    ```1. Convert JSX to an object (using Babel and a method called React.creatElement).

    The result is an object that looks like this

    ```jsx
    const element = {
      type: "h1",
      props: {
        title: "foo",
        children: "Hello",
      },
    }
    ```

2. The `element` will then be passed to `render`.
3. The render method recursively creates DOM nodes for the `element` and its `children`.
    1. The whole process will be done in multiple batches to avoid hogging the main thread. [https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11171#issuecomment-417349573](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11171#issuecomment-417349573). (aka Concurrent mode)
    2. The data structure behind the scene that stores all the "batches" is called a Fiber tree.

4. Once the DOM tree is ready, it's committed to the real DOM. The Fiber tree will also be kept as a reference for the next step.
5. On subsequent updates, steps 1 to 3 are repeated again, the new Fiber tree will then be compared with the existing Fiber (this process is called Reconciliation [https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)), the differences will be committed to the DOM.
