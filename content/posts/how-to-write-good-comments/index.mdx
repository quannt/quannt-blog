Why write comments

- "But my code is perfect", no.
- Provide contexts, the whats, the whys, abstractions, and public interfaces for the code.

> “comments should describe things that aren’t obvious from the code.”
> “Developers should be able to understand the abstraction provided by a module without reading any code other than its externally visible declarations”


*Excerpt From: John Ousterhout. “A Philosophy of Software Design.”*


Types of comments

1. Lower-level comments that add precision to the code.

```c
//  Position in this buffer of the first object that hasn't
//  been returned to the client.
uint32_t offset;
//  Holds statistics about line lengths of the form <length, count>
//  where length is the number of characters in a line (including
//  the newline), and count is the number of lines with
//  exactly that many characters. If there are no lines with
//  a particular length, then there is no entry for that length.
private TreeMap<Integer, Integer> numLinesWithLength;
```

2. Higher-level comments that add high-level information to the code. Good comments answer these questions: what is it that the code trying to achieve here? What's the most important thing about this code? 

```c
// Try to append the current key hash onto an existing
// RPC to the desired server that hasn't been sent yet.”
int readActiveRpcId = RPC_ID_NOT_ASSIGNED;
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_READ_RPC; i++) {
      if (session == readRpc[i].session
                 && readRpc[i].status == LOADING
                 && readRpc[i].maxPos < assignPos
                 && readRpc[i].numHashes < MAX_PKHASHES_PERRPC) {
          readActiveRpcId = i;
          break;
      }
}
```

3. Interface-level comments define the public contract of the code without telling the implementation details.

Bad example

```c
/* This class implements the client side framework for index range
 * lookups. It manages a single LookupIndexKeys RPC and multiple
 * IndexedRead RPCs. Client side just includes "IndexLookup.h" in
 * its header to use IndexLookup class. Several parameters can be set
 * in the config below:
 * - The number of concurrent indexedRead RPCs
 * - The max number of PKHashes a indexedRead RPC can hold at a time
 * - The size of the active PKHashes
 *
 * To use IndexLookup, the client creates an object of this class by
 * providing all necessary information. After construction of
 * IndexLookup, client can call getNext() function to move to next
 * available object. If getNext() returns NULL, it means we reached
 * the last object. Client can use getKey, getKeyLength, getValue,
 * and getValueLength to get object data of current object.
 */
```

Good example

```c
/*
 * This class is used by client applications to make range queries
 * using indexes. Each instance represents a single range query.
 *
 * To start a range query, a client creates an instance of this
 * class. The client can then call getNext() to retrieve the objects
 * in the desired range. For each object returned by getNext(), the
 * caller can invoke getKey(), getKeyLength(), getValue(), and
 * getValueLength() to get information about that object.
 *
 * \param offset
 *        Index within the buffer of the first byte to copy.
 * \param length
 *        Number of bytes to copy.
 * \param dest
 *        Where to copy the bytes: must have room for at least
 *        length bytes.
 *
 * \return
 *        The return value is the actual number of bytes copied,
 *        which may be less than length if the requested range of
 *        bytes extends past the end of the buffer. 0 is returned
 *        if there is no overlap between the requested range and
 *        the actual buffer.
