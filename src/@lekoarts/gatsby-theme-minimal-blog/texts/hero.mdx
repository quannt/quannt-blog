Hello world!

I'm Ngo Tung Quan, a software engineer based in Tokyo, working on [a booking system for Japanese hotels](https://corp.tripla.jp/hotelbooking_new/). My current focused technologies are Vue, React and [the modern frontend development stack](https://jamstack.org/). I also maintain a list of notes on problems/lessons that I'm working on to broaden my knowledge, you can take a look at them [here](https://www.notion.so/quannt/d4438f7d63a046969e76419cdb68d134?v=c353e45ea2044ea088292ce45c88fe6e)
